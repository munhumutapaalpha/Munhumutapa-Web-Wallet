Forging is the creation of blocks on the Munhumutapa blockchain by collecting a number of transactions executed on the platform and grouping them into a sub-legder and then adding it to the ledger which is the block-chain.
In simpler terms, forging on Munhumutapa can be defined as, 'the permanent recording of transactions executed on the platform in a digital publicly-verifiable ledger'. 
Forging accounts are rewarded with the transaction fees paid by the transactions they add to their forged block. Each block can be filled with a maximum of 10 transactions.

All accounts on Munhumutapa can participate in forging as long as they satisfy a few conditions.

- [ ] 1000 MUNHU minimum effective balance.
For an account to be in the running to be nominated as a forger, it has to hold a minimum balance of 1000 Munhumutapa Coins which have been static over the last 1140 blocks. 

- [ ] The account can only forge if it is running on a  node/server.

# Forger Determination 
To win the right to forge a block, Munhumutapa currently uses a Target and Hit random selection algorithm.  To be determined as the forger, a candidate's Hit value has to be less than the Target value.Â 




# Forging Configuration

## How to start Forging.
When an account is logged in on a connected server/node, a user can start forging by selecting the 'Not Forging' alert on the sidebar as shown below and then input their passhrase on the prompt before selecting the 'Start Forging' button.

## Stop Forging
When an account's balance falls below 1000 MUNHU,
automatically, forging is stopped. However, if a user wants to manually stop forging they can also select the 'Forging' alert and enter their account passphrase and then selecting the 'Stop Forging' button.
