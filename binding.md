# Binding
Binding is the collection of transactions from betachains and grouping them into a single transaction which is forwarded to the alphachain to be included in a block.

##Eligibility
Any account can bind transactions provided it has a minimum balance of 500 MUNHU. By choosing to bind, an account agrees to accept a betachain transaction whose fees is paid for in the origin betachain's coin. The binder then groups such transactions into a single betachain transaction and pays the fees for it in MUNHU coins. 

To start binding, on the header choose the settings icon and select binders. At the top-right button corner, select start and configure your binder.

Unlike forging, binding has a number of customizations a user can make. A binder can choose in which betachain it will accept transactions, how much fees it charges for each transaction and also which type(s) of transactions as shown below.
