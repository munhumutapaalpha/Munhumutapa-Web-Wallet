There are quite a number of different types of transactions one can make on the Munhumutapa Alphablockchain so we will take only a few examples as the proceedure is more or less similar.





# Sending a coin
On the header click on the 'coin in hand' icon and select Send. On the following prompt fill in all the required transaction details. 
## Fees: For transactions on the alphachain the fee should generally be 1 MUNHU. For betachain coin transfers, it is recommended for one to check the cheapest binder rate and enter the equivalent fees to that rate. You can also use the calculate button to have the fee automatically calculated and selected. It is important to note that binder rates are usually determined by the betacoin:alphacoin rate. If you want a cheaper rate and own any MUNHU coins you can start and use your own binder.

# Sending a currency
To send a currency, select the 'coin in hand' icon and select Transfer Currency. On the transaction prompt  page, fill each field as required and then click the Transfer Currency Button.

# Advanced Transaction Options 
For more intricate transaction settings, click the advanced link at the bottom of the transaction prompt. 

## Deadline
This is the period in minutes in which you want the transaction to be executed within.

## Phasing Approval
This is when an account or transaction is dependent on the outcome of a vote or if an account is a multi-sig controlled by multiple parties. 

## Finish Height is the block in which you want your transaction should have been executed.
