##Decentralised Finance Betachain
As a part of Munhumutapa's quest to provide a democratic and non-capitalist financial system, a financial services chain is to be hosted on the Munhumutapa Alphablockchain from launch. 

The DFinance chain is purpose-built to create a platform where individual and organised users can create, maintain and possibly sell custom designed financial service packages like insurance, investment portfolios and policy packages. These packages will be autonomous and self designed cutting out the middle man who has made such services inaccessible to the financially deprived population of the African continent.

On the dFinance chain, a user can create a financial package for themselves in which they choose the purpose, subscription amount, service period and payout systems for themselves by themselves. 

- e.g  Let's say a user wants to create a home insurance policy for themselves. Using the already existing p-transactions and autonomous contracts features on Munhumutapa, the user can devise a payment and reward plan suited to their income. 

##How?
Before one creates a dfinance package, they will need define the following:

- purpose of package.
- package financial weight ( how much the package will be worth)
- monthly payments 
- payout intervals (if any)
- bonus payouts
- self-imposed claim conditions 
- self-governed default penalties

Once a user has at least a clear idea of the package, they can go on to create a dfin account which will autonomously run, based on the set parameters, as an insurance agent. 
From the insurance account, the user, using our autonomous contracts, can then define and preset financial actions which the account will execute based on the conditions the creator sets. These actions may be:

- paying or withholding a payout if a payment is missed,
- paying out a bonus for not skipping and payments etc.

A user can then go back to their own main account and create a p-transaction which will paytheir self created and controlled insurance account a monthly premium. 

##Or
A user choose to mimic an already existing package offered by a company, can copy the set of conditions offered by the company for themselves and also the payment plan and reward/claim system.
