The Munhumutapa Alphablockchain is accessible through multiple platforms to cater for our broad user community. Choose the platform that works best for you and your needs, business or personal, and join the blockchain.

# Desktop Wallet
Munhumutapa can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux operating smoothly and with the same code. Munhumutapa is however a, Java based blockchain and so requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be successfully run on desktop. Users of the desktop release of the Munhumutapa Alphablockchain software are therefore required to install a JRE installation for their particular desktop operating system. To make the starting process easier and simpler, we packaged each Munhumutapa software zip folder with the JRE installer for each target operating system. You can download your preferred package below:

## Setup
1. Unzip the downloaded munhumutapa-client-1.1.1 package.
2. Find and install the included jre installer.
3. Launch Munhumutapa with the run-munhumutapa file on Windows, run command on MacOS or run-munhumutapa.sh on Linux.
4. The wallet will automatically open in a desktopFX window.
Optional:
5. Launch the wallet in your favorite browser with the Munhumutapa_wallet_url file.


# Mobile Wallets
For a mobile experience Munhumutapa also has two mobile applications which offer different degrees of feature access. The mobile wallets are simpler and installing any of them gives you ready access to the Munhumutapa Alphablockchain.

## Munhumutapa Mobile
This mobile application has access to all the features of the desktop wallet minus the Munhumutapa Server itself. This wallet relies on a remote server(node) for transaction processing and blockchain interactions. 

## MunhumutapaGo
Like Munhumutapa Mobile app, MunhumutapaGo relies on a remote server for blockchain services but has minimal features. The app is perfect for an on-the-go experience which requires basic functionality like simple transactions and blockchain messaging. This application is lighter and hence less interactive.

## Munhumutapa Mobile Node
To cater for those who wish to, or out of necessity, need to run a full node on mobile, they can make use of the JVdroid app found on App Stores. 

Setup:
1. Download the run-on-android txt file here.
2. Download and install the JVDROID application from your app store.
3. Open the run-on-android file and copy the text.
4. Launch the JVdroid app and wait until the internal installation is complete.
5. From the sidebar pick the 'terminal' option.
6. On the opened terminal, paste the copied text from the run-on-android file.
  and wait until it prints the message
"Wallet UI at localhost:22024"
7. Go to your favorite browser and in the url input bar type"
localhost:22024 
and you have your mobile node and wallet.
8. To run it next time, simply type './run.sh'
