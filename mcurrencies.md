# Mutapa Currency Betachain (mCurrencies)  


# mCurrency

mCurrencies are 1-to-1 pegged digital equivalents to fiat currencies built on top of the Munhumutapa blockchain and are meant to offer local digital currencies for every country in Africa.
Each currency with an active Munhumutapa digital pair can be transacted across the platform and maintain its tether value. mCurrencies will derive their value and supply directly from fiat deposits of their tether currency. In short, for one to acquire an mCurrency, one has to credit Munhumutapa or its agency with an equivalent amount and receive the subsequent mCurrency amount. Through the system, a user will need to deposit money at an agent post and receive an equivalent amount mCurrency into their Munhumutapa account. The user can then spend or send the currency to a recipient through the blockchain. The receiver can, if they choose to, exchange their mCurrency for fiat at an agent post in their location.


# Process:
## Deposits
To acquire an mCurrency;
- 1. Locate and visit a registered agent,
- 2. Exchange a local mCurrency by depositing the equivalent local fiat currency amount based on the official 1-to-1 exchange rate and be credited with the mCurrency in their personal Munhumutapa account,
- 3. Use the mCurrency as one wishes e.g. Send the mCurrency to the recipient address.

## Withdrawal
- 1. Locate and visit a registered agent,
- 2. Exchange an mCurrency by sending it to the agent's address.
- 3. The agent gives the user their equivalent local fiat currency based on the official 1- to-1exchange rate.

Example: The South African Rand (ZAR)
- a currency tether built on Munhumutapa blockchain, specifically, on Mutapa betachain, mZAR will be issued to users who deposit an equivalent amount of fiat ZAR through registered agencies

# System

## To acquire mZAR a user will;
- Locate and visit an agent to whom they can deposit the fiat ZAR and be credited with an equivalent mZAR amount in their Munhumutapa address by the agent.
- Thereafter, the user can make payments for goods and services quoted in ZAR using their Munhumutapa address at mZAR and Munhumutapa Coin accepting paypoints in their respective countries.


## To withdraw mZAR to fiat ZAR;
- The user will go to an agent and send their ZAR to the agent and receive their ZAR equivalent.

## To send;
- The user can simply make a transfer of the mZAR to the recipient's Munhumutapa address.

## To make payments across the border;
- The user can exchange their mZAR to the mCurrency of the recipients country or Munhumutapa Coin and make the payment.Any Munhumutapa account holder will be able to access the coin currency system from their wallet. A user can send, receive and store their mCurrencies with the surety of the currency retaining its value. 

 
# mCurrencies Monetary Features

## Currency Fundamentals
mCurrencies are only issued by Munhumutapa developers (and any other currencies on Mutapa) if and only if Munhumutapa receives the necessary approval and legal mandate to create a digital currency from relevant authorities. This simply means that all the mCurrencies available on Munhumutapa Alphablockchain are signed off by the Reserve Banks of African countries. Initial supplies of these currencies will be agreed by and issued in accordance with Munhumutapa/Reserve Bank agreements.Â 

## mCurrency Minting
If and only if there is a persistent inflow of money onto the platform which may result in short supply of an mCurrency will more be minted. The minting will be done using a proof of work algorithm provided an equal backing fiat is acquired. The maximum amount mintable is predetermined to match user fiat deposits.

## Currency Exchange
-## Bureau Du Change
mCurrencies are exchangeable with each other on a built in exchange. This exchange enables Munhumutapa users to seamlessly convert one currency into another for bill settlements and purchases in different countries from one platform and avoid the rigorous bank run exchange system.
mCurrency conversion is a key component of the Munhumutapa ecosystem as it allows users to seamlessly convert one mCurrency into another or to Munhumutapa Coin. 
This is achieved through a decentralised exchange (Dex) built on top of the alphablockchain. The advantages of such a setup are numerous and include:

- Settlement of payments directly in foreign countries in a local mCurrency on one platform.
- Exchange of received funds to a local currency
- Holding of different continental currencies in one account.
- Through the exchange, users can place ask and bid prices to acquire mCurrencies at official rates. Currency exchange limits exist for each account to curb inflationary activity. 
- To use the exchange, users should be registered and identifiable to deter money launders from accessing the exchange.
