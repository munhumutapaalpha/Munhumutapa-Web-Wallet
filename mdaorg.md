# DAOrg Betachain (mDAOrg)

DAOrgs are Decentrally Administered Organisations and the core functionality of the mDAOrg chain is to provide a legitimate, transparent and efficient platform for the mangement of such organizations. On the chain, people can create, allocate equity and run organizations remotely with the guarantee of fund security and effective records management.  

With mDAOrg, individuals from different parts of Africa can connect and resolve to start an organization whilst coming from different locations and countries on the chain. Say for example,
~ a group of people who share a common idea meet on a social network. They are from different countries but want to start a business together. The first problems they encounter are but not limited to;

Leadership - how and and who is/are chosen as leaders.
Location - where to register and setup the organization 
Logistics - who will switch countries to be part of the organization 
Capital - who invests how much and when and how.
Hiring - who hires and who approves those hired

## Features
### Share Asset  

- ## To create an mDAOrg
Unlike on the alphachain or Mutapa, to create assets on mDAOrg will require a minimum number, n, of members with verified accounts on Munhumutapa. The Member's will also required to provide authenticated proofs of their current addresses an tax clearances. Through a rigorous and thorough vetting process which includes identification of mDAOrg founders, proofs of address and criminal history searches, the betachain will aim to collect sufficient information on an organization's members before it is launched on the platform.

This information will be provided through the mAUTH where users' identities are verified and approved. Such a system will allow future investors to locate and legally take mDAOrg leaders to account in the event of failed organisations, liquidations and management disputes
These mechanisms are necessary to avoid the creation of scam organisations which are very much common on decentralised platforms.

- ## Requirements 
- Minimum number,n, of founding members
Identification of founding members and proofs of addresses
- Initial capital investment pledge,c, total investment, t,
 where c > 25% of t.
- Company registration forms from at least one government 

## Tax Clearance certificate
 After all the necessary documentation and approvals are acquired, only then can a group create a share asset. Investors who buy the issued share assets will also need to be registered to guard against 'tainted money' investments and money 'cleaning'.

# Accounts 
Accounts on mDAOrg differ slightly from those on the alphablockchain. 
On mDAOrg, only organizations can create accounts ie groups of 3 or more people and all are multi-signatory accounts. 
As an organization oriented chain, transactions have a minimum and maximum limits. 
These types of accounts also pay relatively high fees as the transactions are only bundled by permissioned accounts and are added to their own beta-blockchain stored on special nodes. 

# Exchange
An exchange is part of the chain and allows the purchase and sell of asset shares issued on the platform. Founders can set restrictions on the quantity, account eligibility and transferability of their organisation shares. Cases which warrant the need for such functions include undemocratic takeovers of organisations.‎

# Transaction Types
mDAOrg accounts can only execute transactions signed off by a majority of its founding holders ie 50% + 1 of founders. This is meant to prevent fraud and unauthorised use of funds. 
The percentage of funds transferable in a single transaction is limited and can only be exceeded when a majority of the shareholders vote to allow the transaction. Preset transactions can also be activated which act like payroll systems and execute salary payments periodically and can even calculate bonuses and due commissions autonomously.‎
